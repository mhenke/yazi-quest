# User Experience (UX) Audit

**Focus**: Immersion, Feedback, and Spatial Continuity

---

## 1. Spatial Continuity
**Status: 100% Verified**
The "Teleportation" issue is resolved.
- `currentPath` is preserved between levels.
- Contextual navigation bridges have replaced all arbitrary resets.

## 2. Visual Feedback
- ✅ **Standardized HUD**: `Shift+H/L` and `Shift+G` labels clearly communicate modifier requirements.
- ✅ **Stress Overlay**: A scanline flicker/red-glow effect now activates when players reach >85% of their keystroke budget, adding tactile urgency to efficiency levels.
- ✅ **Narrative Errors**: The `🔒 ACCESS DENIED` flavor for reserved PIR names is highly immersive.

## 3. Progression Curve
- **Episode 3 Limits**: Keystroke limits are tight but fair given the tools provided (FZF, Zoxide).
- **Difficulty**: Well-balanced. The transition from linear navigation to quantum jumps is the highlight of the mid-game.

## 4. Overall UX Score: 9.5/10
The simulation is tight, professional, and visually distinct. Adding range selection (Visual Mode) is the final requirement for "Gold" status.
