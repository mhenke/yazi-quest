# Yazi Quest - Master Audit & Project Hub

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-22
**Project Status:** Stable Core / Verification Phase
**System Architecture:** Proactive Identifier Reservation (PIR)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary
The audit system is now streamlined into 5 high-signal pillars. Recent architectural refinements (Result type union) and UI polish (Shift labels, Stress overlay) have been successfully integrated. 

### Structural Pillars
1.  **[TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md](./TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md)**: Architecture, technical debt, and performance.
2.  **[PEDAGOGY_AUDIT.md](./PEDAGOGY_AUDIT.md)**: Yazi realism and educational clarity.
3.  **[OPERATIONAL_SECURITY.md](./OPERATIONAL_SECURITY.md)**: File protection and PIR logic.
4.  **[QA_VERIFICATION.md](./QA_VERIFICATION.md)**: Manual test logs and coverage tracking.
5.  **[USER_EXPERIENCE_AUDIT.md](./USER_EXPERIENCE_AUDIT.md)**: UX polish and narrative continuity.

## 📊 High-Level Status

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Technical Health** | 8.5/10 | ✅ Core Logic Hardened |
| **Yazi Realism** | 9.5/10 | ✨ Excellent Parity |
| **Narrative Logic** | 10/10 | ✅ Continuity 100% |
| **QA Confidence** | 6.5/10 | 🔴 Pending Vitest Coverage |

## 🚧 Active Blocker Tasks (Top 2)
1.  **Automated Coverage**: Achieve >70% coverage on `fsHelpers.ts`. Recursive operations (cloning/deletion) are the highest remaining risk.
2.  **Visual Mode (v/V)**: Range-based selection is the final major pedagogical gap to achieve 100% Yazi parity.

## 📂 Pillar Status
- **Technical**: Core logic stable, but blocked by **0% test coverage**.
- **UI/UX**: Shift-labels standardized. Stress-overlay active.
- **Narrative**: Spatial continuity 100% verified.
