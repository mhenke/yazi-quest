# Navigation Tasks Status (Teleportation Resolution)

**Status:** ✅ ALL RESOLVED
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-21

Spatial continuity is now maintained at 100% across all 18 levels. Intra-episode teleportation has been replaced by player-driven navigation tasks.

- **Bridge Task**: "Navigate to workspace and filter for signatures"
- **Status**: Logic verified.

**Level 12: Root Access** ✅ COMPLETED

## Verification Summary
- [x] `App.tsx` logic preserves `currentPath` unless `episodeId` changes.
- [x] All "Quantum jumps" are justified by Level 7+ Zoxide/G-command unlocks.
- [x] No "teleportation confusion" in manual QA playthrough.
