level 1 completes without K a couple times i think
Preview 'personnel_list.txt' to identify your designation (G to move to it; then use J/K in the preview to scan contents)

Retreat to '/var' (h to go up, enter var with a couple j and l)


=================== DONE ======================

level 2

add a step for recon in the /var folder. it has some lore and the user might find it interesting if they stumble on it


level 1
start in root

Mission Log: LVL 7 - QUANTUM BYPASS

Locate 'access_token.key' using FZF find (z, type and ENTER to jump)

Stage suspicious file for exfiltration (x) is unclear (access_token.key file)

why are we going to ect folder with it? should we take it to tmp or our vault somewhere else to look at it?

"It's a trap. I remember the shape of this code." could show after we complete "Locate 'access_token.key' using FZF find (z)"

Mission Log: LVL 9 - TRACE CLEANUP

seems light. maybe that is ok

on error i re-initialized the level and a task awas alreay completed "Invert the selection to target all junk files (Ctrl+R)"

Level 10

Sort and yank the newest key (make sure complete critiera enforces sort ,m and y)

Why are we going to ~/workspace/systemd-core
Jump to '~/workspace/systemd-core', create 'credentials/' folder, and paste the key

Mission Log: LVL 8 - DAEMON DISGUISE CONSTRUCTION

Preview 'uplink_v1.conf' to confirm corruption (f -> type 'uplink_v1')
 where did uplink_v1.conf.trap come from?

 uplink_v1.conf and uplink_v1.conf aren't realistic it said UPLINK_V1_CONFIG_DATA and UPLINK_V2_CONFIG_DATA 

a process between 4 and 5 was suppose to update it from a blank file. i'm not sure that is working if i pass 4 and go to 5. it might be working if i jump to level 5

level 1
let's have the user retreat to var folder. they might notice the logs and mails to get more backstory


=== 


level 1
Jump to top of file list (gg) should we explain g goToCommands here? instead of

level 2
Open the goto dialog (g). Pause to review other options then navigate to '~/incoming' (i)

should add a couple more K to the reviewing of the file?

====

level 1

should we introduce Preview J/K here with the 'personnel_list.txt' to identify your designation (G to move to it, review in the preview panel)

Level 2

Should we add more K to the file scan like back to the top before marking the task complete. also make the task clear on what we expect for J.K

======

we stil lmention ECHO "an echo offers guidance, but trust is a risk" even though we  **Echo Guide System** | ❌ Removed | Replaced by Ghost mythology |

do we use the map after we move to media? it should probably get to the vault eventually

after we have reforced commands a couple times in episode i and ii, the suquent onces don't need the keybindings


http://localhost:3000/?lvl=5&tasks=all ==== all tasks=all should close any alerts except the mission complete

http://localhost:3000/?lvl=4&tasks=all then go to level 5 with shift+enter and the file structure isn't up to date. is hould have all the changes up to level 4 and include level 4 done


level 8

Navigate to '~/workspace/systemd-core'
Preview 'uplink_v1.conf' to confirm corruption (f -> type 'uplink') ---- remove  -> Esc)
Clear filter (Esc) ---- NEW OBJECTIVE
Perform a jump to '~/.config/vault/active' and yank (y) 'uplink_v1.conf'
Return to '~/workspace/systemd-core' (H) and OVERWRITE (Shift+P) the file





We need to continue fixing navigation notification UI. We attempted to add showNotification call but failed due to target content not found. Need to view file around where to insert. The target block is lines 540-560 we saw earlier. The code after setGameState block ends at line 554. We need to insert showNotification after setGameState call. The target line numbers may have shifted after previous edits. Let's view more context around lines 540-560 again to ensure correct insertion point.

We want it to look like this 



It's a trap. I remember the shape of this code.
I felt that. Why did I feel that?
To self: The system feels loops

wait expect(page.getByText('TRAP ACTIVATED')).toBeVisible();
    > 63 |     await expect(page.getByText('Security team dispatched')).toBeVisible();
