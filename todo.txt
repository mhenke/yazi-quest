level 4

Target

QUARANTINE ALERT. Your activities in the datastore have triggered a defensive handshake from the system. Security daemons are flagging the protocols directory for lockdown. You must evacuate your configuration assets immediately to the hidden stronghold in .config/vault/active.
Objectives
Establish 'vault/active' sector in .config
Batch select both uplink files in datastore/protocols (Space)
Migrate configuration assets to .config/vault/active (p)

NEW ORDER for better flow

batch and x
establish
then migrate/p


Target

LINEAR TRAVERSAL IS COMPROMISED. The security daemon is monitoring the parent-child node connections. To evade detection, you must use the Zoxide Teleportation Protocol (Shift+Z) to 'blink' between distant system nodes. Access the /tmp volatile cache to dump your trace data, then tunnel to /etc to inspect the core routing tables. No trail. No logs. NOTE: Filters persist as you navigate—press Escape to clear when done.
Objectives
Quantum tunnel to /tmp (Shift+Z → 'tmp' → Enter)
Eliminate trace evidence in /tmp: purge 'sys_dump.log' (d, then y)
Quantum tunnel to /etc (Shift+Z → 'etc' → Enter)


remove the file below sys_dup.log so we can use shift-g to get to it and delete it


the objects seem to have a prevfix which was not the norm. unclueare where to go to sort, seems busy work. maybe delete largest bloat, then rename or copy latest time sort.

ANOMALY DETECTED. A heuristic scanner is sweeping the /tmp sector, mirroring your neural signatures. It creates 'ghost' artifacts that capture your metadata. To survive, you must triangulate the scanner's current collection buffer—it's the largest and most recently modified file in the cache. Expose it, and terminate the connection.
Objectives
Triangulate Data Bloat: Identify the massive buffer via Size Sort (,s)
Isolate System Pulse: Verify active collection via Time Sort (,m)
Purge the forensic mirror: 'ghost_process.pid'
