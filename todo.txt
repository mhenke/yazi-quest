level 2

 /home/guest/incoming should be ~/incoming. audit consistency of using ~ appropriately instead of /home/guest



level 3.

i added protocols/uplink_v1.conf in one step and Enter 'protocols/' (l) and create 'uplink_v1.conf' (a) was completed. i never entered the directory


level 5

this seems busy busy work skip them
- sort by modification time (,m)
- Inspect a configuration file's metadata (Tab)


We need to implement this behavor shomewhere maybe on a single space selection TIP: Press Y to cancel if wrong files grabbed.

remove the tip from level 5.

level 6
 (Enter with 'l', then 'y') doesn't fit our pattern in objectives it should be (l,y) i think

level 7
add the Press y to cancel step after jumping to etc. maybe frame it in the lore that we need to purge something there but then decided it is not a threat



level 10
see what you can combine in a logical task. i like what we are doing here just too many objects. example
Invert selection to target real asset (Ctrl+R)
Capture the real asset (y)

could be: Invert selection to target real asset and capture the real asset (Ctrl+R, y)
