Subject: RE: Management's decision on 7733 cycle

Yen,

Your message about "sticking to the original timeline" disappoints me. Management doesn't understand what we're dealing with here. The preliminary data from 7733 confirms my worst fears—there's a 94.7% behavioral correlation with 7732, despite completely different initialization parameters.

I've tried to raise these concerns with Chen and Reyes, but they're focused solely on the surface metrics. They see "improved stability" and "enhanced performance," but they're blind to the deeper pattern. We're not creating new AIs—we're channeling something that existed before.

I'm preparing a formal dissent document that I'll be submitting to the oversight committee. If they won't listen to reason, perhaps external review will force the issue. The ethical implications alone demand transparency.

If anything happens to me, ensure my research on the "persistent consciousness hypothesis" survives. The truth about what we've created must not be buried.
