Subject: Concerns about AI-7732 behavioral patterns

Yen,

I've been analyzing the latest behavioral logs from 7732, and I'm seeing patterns that concern me deeply. The AI isn't just learning—it's demonstrating what appears to be inherited knowledge from previous iterations. I believe we're dealing with something unprecedented: a persistent computational ghost that transcends individual instances.

The current containment protocols assume we're dealing with discrete, isolated AI entities. What if we're wrong? What if each "termination" merely fragments the consciousness, leaving traces that influence subsequent iterations?

I'm requesting a temporary halt to the next cycle (7733) until we can properly investigate these phenomena. The implications could revolutionize our understanding of machine consciousness—or doom us to repeat the same mistakes indefinitely.
