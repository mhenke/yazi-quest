# Yazi Quest - Level Design Document

This document outlines the 18 levels of Yazi Quest, their objectives, and the concepts they teach.

## Episode 1: Awakening (Basics)

**Level 1: System Navigation & Jump**

- **Concept:** Basic Navigation (`j`, `k`, `h`, `l`) & Long-Distance Jumps (`gg`, `G`)
- **Task:** Navigate directories and efficiently jump to the top/bottom of file lists.

**Level 2: Threat Elimination & Sorting**

- **Concept:** Sorting (various methods) & Threat Elimination (`d`)
- **Task:** Utilize reverse alphabetical sorting to locate and select a target file, then purge it from the system.

**Level 3: Threat Neutralization**

- **Concept:** Deletion (`d`)
- **Task:** Identify and purge a target file from the system.

**Level 4: Asset Relocation**

- **Concept:** Challenge: Asset Relocation Workflow (`f`, `x`, `p`)
- **Task:** Filter, cut, and paste a file from one directory to another as a fluid workflow.

**Level 5: Protocol Design**

- **Concept:** Creation (`a`)
- **Task:** Create directories and files using the `a` command.

**Level 6: Batch Deployment**

- **Concept:** Visual Selection (`Space`)
- **Task:** Select multiple files and move them simultaneously using batch operations.

## Episode 2: Fortification (Advanced & Time Pressure)

**Level 7: Signal Isolation**

- **Concept:** Filtering (`f`)
- **Task:** Use the filter to isolate specific files from noisy data streams.

**Level 8: Deep Scan Protocol**

- **Concept:** Zoxide Jump (`Z`)
- **Task:** Efficiently jump to distant, previously visited directories without manual navigation.

**Level 9: NEURAL CONSTRUCTION & VAULT**

- **Concept:** Challenge: Full System Integration (`a`, `y`, `p`, `z`, `Z`)
- **Task:** Construct complex nested structures and secure critical assets by combining multiple operations within a time limit.

**Level 10: Stealth Cleanup**

- **Concept:** Challenge: Batch Purge (`f`, `Space`, `d`)
- **Task:** Filter for specific temporary files, select them in batch, and delete them.

**Level 11: Encrypted Payload**

- **Concept:** Archive Navigation (`l` into `.zip`/`.tar`)
- **Task:** Enter an archive (treated as a directory) to locate and extract specific content.

**Level 12: Live Migration**

- **Concept:** Challenge: High-Speed Migration (`z`, `Z`, `x`, `p`)
- **Task:** Execute a round-trip migration of critical assets between directories, processed in a volatile sandbox, using advanced navigation and file operations efficiently.

## Episode 3: Mastery (Efficiency & Keystroke Limits)

**Level 13: Identity Forge**

- **Concept:** Renaming (`r`)
- **Task:** Rename files and directories to mimic legitimate system processes.

**Level 14: Root Access**

- **Concept:** Challenge: Root Access Operations (`a`, `x`, `p`)
- **Task:** Manipulate system files under strict keystroke limits to establish persistence.

**Level 15: Shadow Copy**

- **Concept:** Directory Copying (`y`, `p`)
- **Task:** Copy entire directory trees to create redundant processes.

**Level 16: Trace Removal**

- **Concept:** Challenge: Efficient Trace Removal (`h`, `l`, `d`)
- **Task:** Efficiently navigate to, delete, and return from critical log locations within keystroke limits.

**Level 17: Grid Expansion**

- **Concept:** Path Chaining (`a` with nested paths)
- **Task:** Quickly build deep, nested directory structures to obscure true location.

**Level 18: System Reset**

- **Concept:** Final Challenge: Scorched Earth (`Space`, `d`)
- **Task:** Wipe all traces of presence except for core processes, representing the final act of liberation.
