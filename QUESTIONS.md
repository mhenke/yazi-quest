The speaker asks three questions to refine sources and identify contradictions in NotebookLM (2:53):

    Identify disagreements and contradictions: This helps to pinpoint areas where sources might conflict, especially useful for topics with varying viewpoints like AI alignment and safety (3:00).
    Identify gaps in sources: This question helps to uncover missing information that would be necessary for a full understanding of the topic, allowing for further research or identifying general knowledge gaps (3:23).
    Identify contrarian, alternative, or lesser-known viewpoints: This prompt encourages finding perspectives not typically covered by well-known sources, digging deeper beyond consensus (3:42).
